## Blockchain-Based Secure e-Portfolio Management System (Research Project)

This project integrates blockchain technology into electronic portfolios (e-portfolios) to enhance security, authenticity, and integrity. It utilizes the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, Pinata for decentralized storage, and Solidity for smart contract development to create a secure platform for managing digital records like achievements, credentials, and personal data.

## Key Features

- **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet**: The system operates on the Sepolia test network, ensuring a cost-effective and risk-free environment for developing and testing blockchain features.
- **Decentralized File Storage**: Pinata is used to store e-portfolio files securely, with IPFS providing a tamper-proof way to access data.
- **Smart Contracts in Solidity**: Developed smart contracts handle credential issuance, verification, and portfolio management, ensuring data immutability and security.
- **User-Friendly DApp Interface**: Built using web technologies, allowing easy interaction with blockchain functionalities for portfolio creation, submission, and verification.

## System Architecture

1. **E-Portfolio Management Layer**: Manages user profiles, credential issuance, and access controls.
2. **Blockchain and Storage Layer**:
   - **Ethereum Sepolia**: Stores transaction data and smart contract interactions.
   - **IPFS/Pinata**: Decentralized storage for documents and multimedia files associated with portfolios.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Framework**: Ethereum Sepolia for deploying smart contracts.
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity for writing contracts that automate e-portfolio processes.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Pinata and IPFS for secure file storage.
- **DApp Interface**: A web-based front-end enabling interaction with blockchain and IPFS.

## Outcomes

The project delivers a decentralized e-portfolio management solution that allows users to securely store, verify, and share achievements and credentials. By using Ethereum Sepolia and Pinata, the system ensures data security, transparency, and authenticity.
